## Abstract
In the realm of multi-agent systems comprised of self-interested agents, the fundamental question revolves around understanding the intricacies of movement coordination. Each agent, functioning as an autonomous entity, is inherently driven by individual goals and preferences. This individualistic motivation introduces a layer of complexity, giving rise to a dynamic environment where collaboration and conflict coexist.

To unravel the mechanisms governing movement coordination, this simulation employs a decentralized approach. The emphasis is placed on investigating how information exchange, consensus algorithms, and adaptive strategies contribute to the overall coordination of agents in their pursuit of individual objectives. The decentralized coordination mechanism serves as a foundational framework for exploring the challenges that arise in such environments.


## Simulations 
### V1.0
- 1D environment
    - agents move left or right
- Social credit system
    - The more social credit the more say that you have in justifications 


## Definitions
- **Agent**: An autonomous entity that is capable of making decisions and taking actions.
- **Environment**: The space in which agents operate.
- **Objective**: The goal that an agent is trying to achieve
- **Consensus**: The process of reaching an agreement or common ground among a group of agents.
- **Coordination**: The process of organizing and integrating the actions of agents to achieve a common goal.
- **Decentralized**: A system in which decision-making is distributed among agents, rather than being controlled by a single entity.
- **Self-Interested**: Acting in one's own interest, often without regard for the interests of others.
